        <p>Is there a more classic midweek dinner than Spag Bol?! üçù

            I‚Äôve taken this family favourite dish and reinvented it to be cooked while you‚Äôre busy all day, totally hands off ‚Äì no faffing. Meet my Slow Cooker Bolognese.
            
            Yes, I mean it when I say we don‚Äôt have to fry off the mince to brown it beforehand, which means this is a true throw-it-all-in slow cooker recipe ‚Äì AKA a trusty ‚Äòdump bag‚Äô dinner.
            
            I love sharing my newly discovered slow cooker hacks with you, and this is the ULTIMATE time-saving method of making this much-loved dish.
            
            I have made sure it‚Äôs packed with rich flavour and the long, slow cooking just enhances the depth of deliciousness. Did I mention how easy it is too?!
            
            I hope you love it as much as we do. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
